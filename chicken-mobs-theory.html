    <h1>Are Chickens Secretly Mob Bosses?</h1>
    <img src="images/chicken-mafia.png" alt="A Minecraft chicken with a fedora and cigar, looking suspicious">

    <p>They act harmless. They cluck. They lay eggs. But we’ve done the research, and it all leads to one conclusion: Minecraft chickens are running the underground mob scene.</p>

    <h2>Evidence #1: They’re Everywhere</h2>
    <div class="evidence">
        <p>They spawn in every biome like they own the place. Coincidence? Or is it a *territory takeover?*</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Evidence #2: The Baby Zombie Chicken Riders</h2>
    <div class="evidence">
        <p>Let’s talk about the *real* power move: carrying literal killers on their backs. That’s not "cute." That’s *protection service.* That’s enforcement.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Evidence #3: They Watch You</h2>
    <div class="evidence">
        <p>Ever stop mining and realize a chicken is staring? They don’t blink. They don’t look away. They *know* what you did to Carl the Cow.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Evidence #4: They Have No Predator</h2>
    <div class="evidence">
        <p>Wolves go for sheep. Foxes chase rabbits. But who messes with chickens? Nobody. Why? Fear. The mob enforces silence.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Conclusion: Cluckin’ Dangerous</h2>
    <p>
        Minecraft chickens are more than passive mobs — they’re the masterminds of the Overworld’s shadow economy. Next time you pass one, toss it a few seeds and mutter "no trouble here." Just in case.
