    <h1>Top 5 Enderman Hairstyles That Scream ‘Mystery’</h1>
    <img src="images/enderman-salon.png" alt="Enderman in a salon chair, looking fierce">

    <p>Endermen: tall, dark, and teleportationally fabulous. But what no one talks about is their *hair game*. You think they’re just smooth-skulled void-walkers? Think again.</p>

    <h2>5. The Dimensional Fade</h2>
    <div class="hair-style">
        <p>This sleek gradient style blends pure black with void purple tips. Only visible when they’re facing exactly 37° east. So exclusive, even they can’t always see it.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>4. The End-Bun</h2>
    <div class="hair-style">
        <p>A messy top bun made entirely of string and chorus fruit juice. Gives major “I just woke up from an existential slumber” vibes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. The Silent Shag</h2>
    <div class="hair-style">
        <p>Long layers with side-swept bangs that conveniently hide their glowing eyes. Mysterious? Yes. Functional in sandstorms? Also yes.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>2. The Portal Bangs</h2>
    <div class="hair-style">
        <p>Short, blunt bangs that shimmer like obsidian and make a *wub-wub* sound when they move. Very high fashion. Very interdimensional runway.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>1. The Voidhawk</h2>
    <div class="hair-style">
        <p>A gravity-defying mohawk made from the screams of defeated players. Holds its shape through rain, fire, and being stared at by Steve.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Honorable Mention: The Bald Mystery</h2>
    <p>
        Some Endermen choose to rock the clean, ominous no-hair look — proving confidence is the best accessory. Also, hair physics are complicated in the End.
