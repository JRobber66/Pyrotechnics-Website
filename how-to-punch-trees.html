    <h1>How to Punch a Tree Like a Pro</h1>
    <img src="images/tree-punching.png" alt="Minecraft player aggressively punching a tree block">

    <p>Starting out in Minecraft? Forget tools. Forget logic. It’s time to commit your first act of pixelated arbor assault — like a true survivalist.</p>

    <h2>Step 1: Choose Your Victim</h2>
    <div class="tip">
        <p>Go for oak — the beginner’s punching bag. Avoid jungle trees unless you want a full-time job and a broken fist.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 2: Fist Positioning</h2>
    <p>Angle your view straight into the log’s soul. Your blocky hand should be vibrating with confusion and rage. That’s how you know you’re ready.</p>

    <h2>Step 3: The Punch</h2>
    <div class="tip">
        <p>Hold down that attack key. This is not a tap. This is a *long-term relationship* with bark.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Step 4: Grab That Log</h2>
    <p>One log down, the world at your feet. Now repeat. Forever. Because punching one tree just leads to punching more trees. That’s called deforestation — and progress.</p>

    <h2>Pro Tips</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Punch in rhythm to dubstep music for 23% increased satisfaction.</li>
        <li>Talk to the tree before punching it. It won’t help, but it’ll confuse nearby players.</li>
        <li>Set your render distance to “Regret” for ultimate immersion.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Final Words</h2>
    <p>
        Never forget: every wood plank in your house started with a barehanded beatdown. You’re not just a player — you’re a professional tree-punching legend.
