    <h1>Sleeping in the Nether: What Could Go Wrong?</h1>
    <img src="images/nether-bed-explosion.png" alt="A Nether bed mid-explosion, surrounded by fire and regret">

    <p>So you’re deep in the Nether, the lava's flowing, piglins are vibing, and you’re thinking: “Wow, I could really use a nap.”</p>

    <p>We’ve all been there. But let us stop you right now. If you try to sleep in the Nether, you’re not getting rest. You’re getting a one-way ticket to BOOMsville.</p>

    <h2>But Why Though?</h2>
    <div class="boom">
        <p>Minecraft lore says you can’t dream in hell. So instead of sleeping, the bed self-destructs. Think of it as the bed flipping YOU off.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Explosion Facts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Damage radius: big enough to erase your hopes and items</li>
        <li>Block destruction: absolutely, yes</li>
        <li>Chance of survival: depends on how recently you angered the RNG gods</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What to Do Instead</h2>
    <p>
        Need a spawn point? Use a <strong>Respawn Anchor</strong>, a.k.a. the “Totally Not A Bed” bed. Just charge it with glowstone and don't ask questions.
    </p>

    <h2>Common Last Words:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>"Just gonna set my spawn real quick..."</li>
        <li>"What's the worst that could happen?"</li>
        <li>"BRUH"</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Pro Tip:</h2>
    <p>
        Trick your friends by decorating a Nether hotel with beds. Call it the “Boom & Breakfast.” Profit from their poor decision-making.
